# Female Filmmakers Database

This project is a web application/database about women in the film industry.<br>
It was built as a task for Achievement 3 in [CareerFoundry's Full-Stack Web Development program](https://careerfoundry.com/en/courses/become-a-web-developer) and uses the RESTful [Movie API](https://github.com/NeleSchallenberg/movie-api) from Achievement 2.

## About

For now, the web application provides users with access to information about different feature-length movies (with a minimum of 80 minutes as defined by the Screen Actors Guild) by several female directors.<br>
Users are able to

- sign up
- view information about different movies
- update their personal information
- delete their profile

### Features that will be implemented/fixed:

- Search bar functionality
- Displaying favorite movies in user profile
