#Female Filmmakers Database

This project is a web application/database about women in the film industry.
It was built built as a task for Achievement 3 in Career Foundry's Full-Stack Web Development Program and uses the RESTful Movie API from Achievement.

For now, the web application provides users with access to information about different feature-length movies (with a minimum of 80 minutes as defined by the Screen Actors Guild) by several female directors. For now, the database consists of several female directors and their Users are able to sign up, update their personal information and create a list of their favorite movies.

In the future, I want to update the database with women in other off-screen professions such as writers, cinematographers and production designers and include a function to find a specific person by name and receive general information about them, as well as a list of their work.
